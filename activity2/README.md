# Activities

## Task 1

Refer to the first [link](#links).

- Why is Algorithm Analysis Important?
- Explain the Big $O$ notation
- Compare `Linear`, `Logarithmic`, `Quadratic` and `Constant` complexities.

## Task2

Refer to the first [link](#links).

- Write a simple algorithm in C++ that finds the square of the first item in a list and then prints it on the screen.
- What is the complexity of the algorithm?
-constant

## Task 3

Refer to the first [link](#links).

- Write a simple program that displays all items in a list to the console.
- What is the complexity of the algorithm?
-linear

## Task 4: : Individual, at home

Refer to this [pdf](./big_o.pdf):

- What is the difference between complexity and performance:
Performance: how much time/memory/disk/... is actually used when a program is
run. This depends on the machine, compiler, etc. as well as the code.
2. Complexity: how do the resource requirements of a program or algorithm scale,
i.e., what happens as the size of the problem being solved gets larger?
- Does complexity affects performance bor is it the other way around?Complexity affects performance
- Restate the formal definition of big $O$ in plain English
Big O -how to calculate algorthms effectivness.
